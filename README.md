# CRUD_App
My first repository for my first project on github.
The project is based on CRUD Operations and the title of my project is Student Management System.
In this, data related to students like name, roll number etc. can be stored and the following operations can be performed on the stored data
C - Create
R - Read
U - Update
D - Delete
-> Implementation of this project can be converted to similar systems (like Library Management System) and also extended to the upper level.
