# Student Management System (CRUD App) in C

My first repository for my first project **(Student Management System)** on github. <br>
The project is created in and based on CRUD operations, means you can create an object for a student, read data in the object, update data in the object, and delete an object.
In this, data related to students like name, roll number etc. can be stored and the following operations can be performed on the stored data. <br>
C - Create <br>
R - Read <br>
U - Update <br>
D - Delete <br>

>Implementation of this project can be converted to similar applications (like Library Management System, Banking System, Hospital Management System, Railway Reservation System) and it can also be extended to the advance level.
